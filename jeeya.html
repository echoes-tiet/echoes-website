              <br><br>
              When it comes to writing, it is less recreational and more of a getaway for me. Back in 2014, when I was in
              school, I used to pour my heart out and only showed it to my best friend, who initially told me that I could
              write well and should continue. Luckily, I discovered a platform named Miraquill, a creative space for poets
              and story writers. Ever since I signed up for it, I met some of the most creative people who inspired me.
              Although I identify myself as an engineer who wants to make a career in finance, I enjoy writing and don't
              plan to quit.

              Q. What would be your best piece of advice for an amateur writer just stepping into the field of poetry or

<br>
<br>
            </strong>
            One should never rush into the process of getting their book published. Art forms require the right amount
            of time to build. While working on my book, I often thought of publishing it as soon as possible. But now
            that I look back, there was no need to rush. I could have given myself more time to process things in a
            better way. I could have refined my writings, spent more time searching for better publishing houses and
            figured out what was best for me.

              Q. Being the co-founder of Humans of TIET, what, according to you, was the inspiration and motive behind
              the venture?


            </strong>
            <br>
            <br>
            I think the inspiration for "Humans of TIET" came from "Humans of Bombay" and "Humans of New York." Our
            motive was to do something for society and interact with people because it was uniquely about the humans of
            TIET, and we believe in students' voices. I am proud of the fact that the entire team of "Humans of TIET"
            has so many ideas. It’s a place that consumes your opinion, nourishes it, and gives it the right direction.

            <strong style="color: rgba(255, 229, 229, 1);">
              Q. Since you have successfully published your first book, "Mirror," what challenges did you face in
              searching for and convincing a suitable publication?


            </strong>
<br>
<br>

            Ever since I was in 12th standard, I wanted to have one of my books published. So, I kept sending my drafts
            to different publishers. Often, they didn't even reply. It was very disheartening, but eventually, I got in
            touch with a publication. They were patient when it came to the details of how I wanted to present my book.
            I was in a rush to get it published. If I had waited and figured out the proper process, maybe things would
            have been different.
            <br>

            <strong style="color: rgba(255, 229, 229, 1);">
              Q. How was your experience about interning at IIIT Allahabad in the field of Neurofinance?


            </strong>
            <br>
            <br>
            The reason why I took this internship was to learn about finance. I chose Neuro finance for research. Back
            then, I was just a beginner and had no idea, so I crammed up a few things that my dad told me. He has a
            substantial interest in the stock market, and I felt left out at the dinner table conversations. It
            interests me because it is upcoming, and it harbours scope for many breakthroughs. My work consisted of
            studying what basic finance is and writing review papers. This internship gave me more exposure in this
            field. It was a defining point in my life. Through this, I realized that I wanted to pursue a career in
            finance and not tech.

              Q. Since you have successfully published your first book, "Mirror," what challenges did you face in
              searching for and convincing a suitable publication?


            </strong>

            Ever since I was in 12th standard, I wanted to have one of my books published. So, I kept sending my drafts
            to different publishers. Often, they didn't even reply. It was very disheartening, but eventually, I got in
            touch with a publication. They were patient when it came to the details of how I wanted to present my book.
            I was in a rush to get it published. If I had waited and figured out the proper process, maybe things would
            have been different.

              Q. How was your experience about interning at IIIT Allahabad in the field of Neurofinance?


            </strong>
            <br>
            <br>
            The reason why I took this internship was to learn about finance. I chose Neuro finance for research. Back
            then, I was just a beginner and had no idea, so I crammed up a few things that my dad told me. He has a
            substantial interest in the stock market, and I felt left out at the dinner table conversations. It
            interests me because it is upcoming, and it harbours scope for many breakthroughs. My work consisted of
            studying what basic finance is and writing review papers. This internship gave me more exposure in this
            field. It was a defining point in my life. Through this, I realized that I wanted to pursue a career in
            finance and not tech.
