            <p style="color: rgba(210, 241, 219, 1);"><br><b>Q. The COVID-19 pandemic has affected educational systems worldwide, leading to the near-total closures of schools, universities and colleges. How do you think it has affected college life?</b><br>

            <br>COVID-19 brought many challenges to the world as well as the education system. But this could be seen in a positive light as digitalization accelerated during this period. Certain things, including classroom learning, experiences of hostel life, and all the co-curricular activities that cannot be substituted, would negatively impact the overall development of students.

            <br>This scenario might also be an advantage as it taught us how to face challenges and grab various opportunities while adapting to immediate changes, which are helpful in the corporate world. People also saw technological advancement and made themselves adhere to it in minimum time.

            
            <br><br>
           <b style="color: rgba(255, 229, 229, 1);">
            Q. Holding the vital position of Country President and MD for Schneider Electric India requires you to show a great sense of responsibility and diligence. What are some of the principles that one should follow to achieve extraordinary things in life?</b>
<br><br>
Everyone needs to follow their passion and work with great focus on their goal, irrespective of your work domain, leading to success. Expansion of vision along with time also plays a vital role. It is also essential for every individual to invest in personal and professional development.

<br>While working as a team, acknowledgement of good work and keeping the group motivated serves the purpose. So, 'Collaboration brings success' is the key to achieving heights.
<br><br>
<b style="color: rgba(255, 229, 229, 1);">Q. Generally, quite many multinational companies don't utilize the Indian workforce in research and development activities. Most of the R&D work is done in European and American regions. This had led to people being overly dependent on the IT industry for a reasonable employment opportunity. Can you suggest some measures that can bring a change in this scenario?</b>

<br><br>Presently, the situation is changing, as India is a significant contributor to the economy and technology at the global level. The only way to further accelerate in the field of technology is to take the risk of development. The environment required for this is coming up in India, which encourages youth to step into innovations. Earlier, Schneider Electric had its three hubs in Europe, the US, and China, respectively. Though, now the fourth one is created in India, which is a significant step showing the advancement in the country.

To better the present scenario, India should assure the developments first for the nation and then worldwide. Some changes in the education system, encouraging cooperative working, can also lead us to the goal.


<br><br><b style="color: rgba(255, 229, 229, 1);">Q. In June 2021, India dropped two positions and was ranked 117th in The United Nations' sustainable development goals by 2030 initiative. According to you, how difficult will it be to build a resilient future and foster innovation in a country like India, considering your company's motto and goals?</b>



<br><br>India's rank might have dropped by two, but we are making considerable progress in many sectors and are emerging as a larger economy. Schneider Electric is committed to the sustainability of the environment and has even adopted United Nations sustainable development goals. We are also constantly working towards the possible solutions to reduce the impact on the environment by our business and have plans to achieve carbon neutrality by 2030. Bringing electric and digital fields together is one of the most critical aspects of achieving sustainability goals. Since India is a developing country, focusing on energy efficiency can accelerate development and decrease overall consumption.



<br><br><b style="color: rgba(255, 229, 229, 1);">Q. After graduating from Thapar, you joined Alstom and Cegelec, working for nearly 26 years. What made you step out of your comfort zone and take a leap of faith and switch your job and that too for a sales position?</b>




<br><br>Stepping out of your comfort zone is essential for growth. So I took the opportunity to work in India for Schneider Electric offered by the chairman as I wanted to sail in the ocean. It was a big decision as Schneider was not a big company but had a grand vision of sustainability and digitalization.  




<br><br><b style="color: rgba(255, 229, 229, 1);">Q. In a very competitive world, only bookish knowledge isn't sufficient. The importance of practical knowledge is highly valued. Thus how do you feel in today's world, students can gain valuable knowledge?</b>




<br><br>Nowadays, even education is becoming digital, but books were the only source of knowledge in our time. Books along with practical knowledge are the much-needed combination. 

Classroom learning plays a vital role in every scenario. Technology nowadays allows us to connect with different companies via projects. Students can also expand their knowledge without restricting their learning in one particular field. So, joining various organizations during your learning period to gain some practical experience is always advisable.
