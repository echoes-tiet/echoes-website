  <section id="blog-content">
    <p>People fear for their lives simply because they love. If you ask me, it’s rather sad that love is countered with hate. Every person is unique and they are a manifestation of all their choices- of what they support, of what they condemn, who they adore, and how they adore. There’s a whole spectrum of these shades of affection that people share. It’s so embedded in souls that the individual carries these aspects of their identity wherever they go. But there has been concentrated hatred towards this sacred concept of being oneself and for long people have been suffering and well, fighting.
    <br>
    </p>
    <p>Sexual orientation has often been a sensitive topic to bring to the table in our society. But even today, in 2021, I find fellow peers of mine passing snide remarks about orientations. People of the LGBTQIA+ community have been facing extreme forms of alienation and biases for a long, long time. The excuses regarding this are very rudimentary too. Many of us have grown up in households that were hostile to the concept of sexual orientation. But to use that as an excuse? In my adolescence too, I came across ideas, revolutions, and unlearnt prejudices. There is no excuse for homophobia, transphobia, or any sort of discrimination. If you were raised a certain way, unlearn it. It’s not rocket science. It’s a mere sense of consciousness; a simple call of humanity. Inclusivity is a humane thing and turning a blind eye to the homophobia bubbling anywhere is a threat to this very concept. Internalized homophobia, in the shadow of a homophobic society, succeeds in suffocating every ounce of hope that an individual carries regarding themselves. Homophobia often roots down to the existence of toxic masculinity as well. Something is either too feminine or too masculine in a world that runs on nothing but air and water.
    </p>
    <p>And why should one suffer from these glaring biases? Where do they start and when do they end? Sexuality has had a rather surprising history when our ancient texts are penned down. India, to say the least, shouldn’t worry about homosexuality not being a part of the traditional code. It was never illegal or a criminal offense in ancient India but was criminalized during the 1860s. A flip through years of research on our ancient texts distinctly portrays the acceptance of gender fluidity much before modern existence. And through these recent years, maybe we have realized that our ancestors were, indeed, more progressive than what we claim to be.
    <br><br>
    On September 6, 2018, India's Supreme Court penned down Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code, ruling that consensual homosexual acts would no longer constitute a crime. This was a small step. As we grapple with the legality of same-sex marriages, this feels like a small step. But I have seen people smile...seen them cry when they said their love isn’t a crime anymore some few years back. We’ve got a very long way to go for us to give this community their rights and a kinder world that they deserve. And I wonder how we forgot the essence of the very emotion that concretes humanity- love? How long before every sexuality is deemed equal? These are the questions that stay heavy on my tongue for now.
    <br><br>
    But I think it all starts with us, right? What can we do, as we see this community never fail to stand their ground and carry on with hopes and aspirations? If you wish to change the world, be the change. Welcome these differences with your heart. If you feel confused, ask an ally. Reach out to the members of the community itself. Normalize the discussion about the differences in gender and sexuality. Learn the importance of pronouns. If you carry questions regarding your orientation, talk about it and know that you are not alone. Implement proper discussions revolving around sexual health and identity. Intervene when your circle jokes about sensitive matters and educate them. Stand up against any form of discrimination not only because you should but also because you want to. <i>Be the change</i>.
    <br><br>
    So someday, when we have the world in all its colors; where one can paint oneself in any shade they like, we will look back at these defining struggles with a wistful smile and remember to be kind. Someday, we will realize the true meaning of ‘omnia vincit amor’, simply <i>love conquers all</i>.
    <br><br>
    And that will be our utopia.
