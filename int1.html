            Echoes Club interviewed Mr Antarpreet Singh, an alumnus from the 1983 batch who is currently the founder of ADTA, a digital transformation advisory engaged with premier B-schools. ADTA provides teaching, consultation, research, and mentorship services in many distinguished fields. Mr Singh has more than 36 years of working experience and has served as the Director of Digital Learning at the Indian School of Business(ISB). He believes in the power of youth and, through his powers, is moulding up the next generation of leaders to usher the world into a brighter future.</p>

In this day and age, distance learning, online courses, and digital training have increased significantly. Not to mention that the pandemic alone has facilitated the transition of 91% of global institutions to online curriculum.

            <br>Although online learning is more flexible and accessible, do you agree that certain aspects of education can only be taught through hands-on experience?</b>

            <br><br>The pandemic hugely accelerated the adoption and transition to digital learning. But, online learning alone won’t be sustainable for our education system; we need a hybrid model for the long term. Digital classrooms and online learning have become an integral part of our education system for the present and the future. Still, in conjunction with it, we need the traditional Guru-Shishya model, which includes face-to-face interaction of the teacher with students.

             It could enhance offline education using digital resources like apps, simulations, and recorded videos. Participating in various extracurricular activities and sports during my time in Thapar contributed to my overall development, which isn’t possible through the online medium. So, an amalgamation of digital and physical learning models is the ideal way forward.<br><br>
            
            <br>
           <b style="color: rgba(255, 229, 229, 1);">Q. As the Director of Digital Learning at ISB, you introduced new initiatives for Digital Learning and Education. What are some aspects of our Indian Education System that need a digital overhaul for its betterment?</b>
<br><br>
            I was part of ISB for a tenure of 3 years. Now I am pursuing a PhD from IIM Indore.

            Digital knows no political boundary. ISB, one of the best B-schools in Asia, had two campuses. Along with that, ISB launched an ambitious effort as they needed someone from the industry. I took up this challenge.

            We called this digital campus our third campus; it helped specific short-term certifications for engineering graduates. It’s suitable for short-term courses, but we have to merge both digital and physical modes of education for the long-term ones.

            Although devastating for humanity, the pandemic acted as a catalyst for digital reforms, and ISB also accelerated its digital learning ventures.

            Even in pre-covid times, if an industrial conglomerate had to train 2000 employees in a sales-related course, the physical campus wasn’t possible because they depended upon online training.
<br><br>
<b style="color: rgba(255, 229, 229, 1);">Q. In one of your blogs, you once wrote that “I learn from youngsters”, so what differences do you find between youngsters today and back when you graduated and how it encourages you.</b>

<br><br>I would like to refer to the millennials born after the ‘80s as digital natives. Since I was born in 1962, I would consider myself a digital immigrant.

I have learnt a lot from the digital natives. Their intensity to understand and showcase purposive behaviour and explore new opportunities inspired me. After finishing my graduation, almost everyone I knew dreamed of cracking civil services or joining an MNC. The startup culture didn’t exist back then. Today the total number of unicorns is 800, and the total market capitalization is almost 3 trillion US dollars, in which India ranks at 3rd position after the USA and China. So, the youngsters are doing quite well.

Risk appetite at my time among people was close to none, but today the youngsters are taking well managed and calculated risks without fear. They are straightforward and tend to express their opinions without any hesitation.



<br><br><b style="color: rgba(255, 229, 229, 1);">Q. Your venture ADTA provides teaching and mentoring services to corporate employees to develop their soft skills. What areas of self-development should the students who will enter the corporate world soon focus on to prepare for the modern demands?</b>



<br><br>Since I always wanted to be a teacher and mentor, my venture ADTA helps corporations and helps set up, design and build corporate academies. We help corporations build digital transformation programs. I have split my time into 50% in teaching,30% in management research and 20% in consulting. I am a guest faculty with MDI Gurgaon and FORE, Delhi and occasionally to FMS, Delhi. I am also teaching business research and may lead as a professor full time down the line or continue splitting my time at ADTA. ADTA is a platform to launch all these initiatives, and if I get a more prominent platform, I may shift to teaching these skills.

The skills required may be conceptual skills because they provide you with the framework and help you understand practical business and technology issues.

It will help you to know that technology is not an end. It is a human-machine collaboration to add business value.



<br><br><b style="color: rgba(255, 229, 229, 1);">Q. Due to the pandemic, unfortunately, our classes are going via an online medium. I would like to hear your insights on how campus life develops an individual in various aspects. What role did Thapar play in shaping your personality?</b>



<br><br>I entered Thapar 42 years ago, and the world has changed since then, so it would be unfair to compare the campus life back then to the present day. These days digital classrooms are being used as an alternative for continuing learning, but there is no substitute for campus life.

In my opinion, campus life is a crucial aspect of the overall development of any student because it provides the student with an interactive and well-rounded experience. The experience and knowledge one gains from face to face interaction with other students on the campus and the faculty is unparalleled. Although four decades have passed since I was a student here, the spirit among the campus residents of helping and supporting each other is still intact. Campus takes the place of home in our lives. The morals of friendship, kindness, and togetherness have an everlasting impact on our lives.



<br><br><b style="color: rgba(255, 229, 229, 1);">Q. What would be your one piece of advice to the younger generation that is slowly and steadily picking up the reigns of the future?</b>



<br><br>My advice to the students would be that they should be aware of their capabilities and goals at all times. Trying out new things just by falling into the trap of peer pressure does more harm than good.

If someone takes a step towards something in life, they might face struggles initially, but eventually, they will get past those hurdles if dedicated to the goal as life is a long journey with thousands of steps. People who keep an honest, dedicated and sincere approach towards life eventually achieve the milestones they desire to reach.

As sweet it is, success can also be harmful if a person becomes complacent about their achievements. Success can blind you, but failure always teaches. One should always stay humble in life and strive to learn and improve from failures.
